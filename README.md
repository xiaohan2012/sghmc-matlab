# Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo: Matlab Implementation

This implementation originates directly from [Chen, 2014](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4102)

This is also produced for [Seminar in Probabilistic Models for Big Data](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/en/courses/58314301/2014/s/s/1) organized by University of Helsinki.
